# GetMyID Telegram Bot

GetMyID Bot is a simple Telegram bot that allows users to retrieve their Telegram user ID by sending the `/getmyid` command. The bot responds with the user's ID in a copy-friendly format.

## Features

- **Get User ID**: Users can send the `/getmyid` `/id` `/myid`command to receive their Telegram user ID.
- **Copy-Friendly Format**: The user ID is sent in a format that can be easily copied.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Built with Node.js and the `node-telegram-bot-api` library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js 18.x**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Obtain a bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram.

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies using npm:

   The ID is displayed in a copy-friendly format.
